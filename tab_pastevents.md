  - **Gamification of Threat Modelling - Grant Ongers**  \[ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg0EtIYUoyQ) \]
    
    Helping your teams perform all important threat modelling in a way that doesn’t require a huge security team, or prevent delivery from being at the speed that the business requires. We do this as part of a normal agile delivery through backlog scrubbing, using gamification and OWASP Cornucopia.
    
  - **An introduction to OWASP ZAP - Simon Bennetts**  \[ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtFVJm2j3vQ) \]
  
  
  #### Speakers
    
- **Grant Ongers**

Grant is co-founder of the bearded trio called Secure Delivery. The philosophy and purpose of the organisation is in the name: optimal delivery and security in one dynamic package.
Grant’s versatile experience in information systems spans Dev - building management platforms for some of the world’s largest Telcos, MSPs and Financial groups for more than 10 years. Twenty-plus years in Ops, doing everything from running operational teams in global NOCs to managing mainframe and database systems. He also has over thirty years pushing the limits of (Info)Sec - mostly white-hat. He’s done time on both sides of the TPSA (security assessment) table working for and with regulated organisations ensuring compliance and matching appetite with acceptance of risk.

  - **Detecting secrets in code committed to Gitlab (in real time) - Chandrapal Badshah**  \[ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCDgUvXZ_YE) \]
    
    There are so many open source tools that can detect sensitive API keys (secrets) in git repos. But theres no single tool that can be integrated to help you achieve real time secrets detection. This talk is about the experiment on how we implemented a real time git secrets monitoring solution. 

        This talk will cover the following:
         * Problem we had
         * Techniques to solve that
         * Existing tools that can help us
         * Comparison of tools
         * Final architecture and product
         * What we learnt from the experiment
         * Future enhancements
  
  #### Speakers
    
Chandrapal Badshah is a Security Engineer by day who manages security of a rapidly scaling company. He manages “Hack with GitHub” – an initiative to showcase open source security tools on GitHub. He has given multiple talks including those at null community monthly meets. Even during his busy days, he spends some time reading books not limited to philosophy and exploring nature.

  - **Living In A World of Zero Trust - Vandana Verma**  \[ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Hs7JPRjgg) \]
    
    As now everything is moving to cloud, all the applications are accessible from anywhere and everywhere. However, No one wants their private information to be compromised and openly available for the world. We have been taking so many precautions, however breaches continue to happen. How should we fix this?

    Organisations have been talking about Zero Trust lately and this has become a buzzword. The talk will explore Zero Trust beyond the buzzword and describe what exactly is Zero Trust and why it is so important to keep organisations safe. How can we implement or deploy Zero Trust in an organisation while keeping the current and future state of an organization in mind. What should be the business model to move any organisation towards Zero Trust Architecture and what all policies need to be implemented to achieve the same.
  #### Speakers
    
  Vandana has over 14 years of experience and comes from strong application security background and has been working on Cloud Security, Application security, Vulnerability assessment, secure code review, threat profiling and remediation support for web/client server applications on different technologies based on Secure Design/Development guidelines and OWASP standards/guidelines.

  Vandana has been a speaker and trainer at security events including Blackhat USA 2019, BSides LV 2019, Diana Initiative, Defcon (AppSec Village), AppSec California 2019, Global Appsec EU 2018, Global Appsec USA 2018, Global AppSec Tel Aviv, BSides Delhi 2018, c0c0n 2017 and Nullcon etc. She has trained over 3000+ Women in cybersecurity.

  - **how to prevent Dev from committing secrets and credentials into git repositories - Abhinav Sejpal** \[ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESGZ_Di7CtM) \]
    
    Sensitive information such as the AWS keys, access tokens, SSH keys etc. are often erroneously leaked via the public source code repositories due to accidental git commits. This can be avoided by using pre-commit hooks like “Talisman” which checks for sensitive information in the files before commits or push activity.

### [4 November 2019 (Ipswich)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/265681990/)

Location:   University of Suffolk, Waterfront Building, 19 Neptune Quay,

#### Agenda:

  - **OWASP Suffolk Introduction, Welcome and News - WTC**

    Welcome and an update on OWASP Projects & Events from the OWASP
    Suffolk Chapter Leader.
 
  - **Practical Threat Analysis – Martin Russ** \[
    [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/owaspsuffolk/practical-threat-analysis-martin-russ)
    \]\[ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lI4ZJom3u0) \]
 
     Martin Russ shows you how to actually do Threat Analysis using a
    simple spreadsheet as a guide. The key to successful threat analysis
    and modelling is to have a clear idea of how to get to the
    end-point, and not to get overwhelmed with how you are going to get
    there\! Having a simple guide makes this much easier, but there
    aren’t many examples out there - this turns to be one of those
    rare topics where Google searches don’t return much that is
    particularly useful. So we will be using a very straight-forward
    approach that isn’t scary or hard to understand, and which doesn’t
    require a brain the size of a planet. or the services of an
    expensive consultant\!

#### Speakers

  - Martin Russ passed the CISSP exam in just over four hours (you are
    allowed to take six\!), but has just lapsed and returned to the
    status of mere mortal. He worked in the Security Engineering
    department of a major US utility metering company for nearly ten
    years, and knows too much about hacking devices that measure, or web
    front-ends that interface to the real world, or cloud back-ends that
    assume that replication is a substitute for backups… He has always
    wanted a t-shirt that says: ‘There’s no way that could ever happen…’
    because he has heard it too many times in security workshops...

    \] \[ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sHn_PEFF0o&t=867s) \]
 
    Servers are the root of all web apps and sites, it’s the central
    point that your clients/customers will connect to and where you put
    your code.
    Many small and under resource companies that do there own hosting
    don’t normally put the time and investment in there hosting
    technology and this is where it starts to go wrong.
    This talk will discuss what some of the dangers are and what could
    happen if an attacker gets into your infrastructure, we will also
    talk about how some simple changes to the infrastructure can reduce
    the risk of being attacked.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Discussion about future of OWASP Suffolk**
 
    We will have open discussion about what we are doing, and what YOU
    expecting us to do.

#### Speakers

  - Edward Ogden has been in the IT industry for only 6 years and has
    learnt most of his skill on the job. He started his career as a web
    developer progressing on to operations side of the industry.
    Currently he is working for SETL Ltd as a DevOps engineer automating
    code deploys for client around the world. As a young child he was
    always interested in servers starting off by hosting gaming servers

  - **Windows Active Directory Security Lowlights - Barry Myles**
 
    Once an attacker is inside your organisation they very often will
    misuse Windows Active Directory for almost total compromise of every
    aspect of an organisation's computing infrastructure and the data it
    holds. This talk will describe how an attacker might do this, when
    they have done so in the past, the kinds of tools they would use,
    what common mistakes enable this, and how organisations could go
    about defending themselves both through changes in behaviour and
    changes to their setup.

#### Speakers

  - Barry Myles leads an internal penetration testing team at BT,
    although tries to stay away from very traditional views of pen
    testing as much as possible. After becoming somewhat bored and jaded
    with project management work in 2006 he decided the life on an
    attacker was a very much more fun, but perhaps less constructive way
    of life. He enjoys large scale scanning, reverse engineering,
    cryptography, hardware hacking and network protocols a bit too much.

  - **Understanding how to prevent Sensitive Data Exposure - Simon
    Greatrix** \[
    [](/www-pdf-archive/Owaspsuffollk-20190319.pdf )[PDF](https://www.slideshare.net/owaspsuffolk/understanding-how-to-prevent-sensitive-data-exposure)
    \] \[ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1nNq3wt7Bg) \]

 
    Sensitive data is often the target of any attack, and its exposure
    has the greatest risk of long-term damage. OWASP and the PCI DSS
    provide many recommendations. The internet provides even more. These
    can be hard to understand, hard to implement, and contradictory. I
    will be sharing my understanding of how the cryptographic algorithms
    work and how they should best be used.

#### Speakers

  - Dr Simon Greatrix has been writing software since the late 70s and
    has worked as a security expert for e-commerce for nearly 20 years.
    He is currently working on SETL’s block chain product. Java has been
    his preferred programming language since 1996.
