Venue : Remote

TALKS:

* OWASP Suffolk Introduction, Welcome and News - WTC

Welcome and an update on OWASP Projects & Events from the OWASP Suffolk Chapter Leader.


* Living In A World of Zero Trust - Vandana Verma


As now everything is moving to cloud, all the applications are accessible from anywhere and everywhere. However, No one wants their private information to be compromised and openly available for the world. We have been taking so many precautions, however breaches continue to happen. How should we fix this?


Presentation : https://meet.jit.si/OWASPSuffolk

Organisations have been talking about Zero Trust lately and this has become a buzzword. The talk will explore Zero Trust beyond the buzzword and describe what exactly is Zero Trust and why it is so important to keep organisations safe. How can we implement or deploy Zero Trust in an organisation while keeping the current and future state of an organization in mind. What should be the business model to move any organisation towards Zero Trust Architecture and what all policies need to be implemented to achieve the same.

About the speaker:
Vandana has over 14 years of experience and comes from strong application security background and has been working on Cloud Security, Application security, Vulnerability assessment, secure code review, threat profiling and remediation support for web/client server applications on different technologies based on Secure Design/Development guidelines and OWASP standards/guidelines.
